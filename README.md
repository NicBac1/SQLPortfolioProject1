# SQLPortfolioProject1
For this project I use SQL and Tableau I gather clean and analyze large data sets. The first file "DataQueeryScriptsCovid2022.sql" is an Analytic overview of the covid19 pandemic-- pulling data in relation to covid deaths/vaccinations/infections. etc.  
The other files are an analytic overview of prices in regards to airfare and lodging to book a trip to Hawaii in 2022.
